      </ul>

     <h2 id="jump1">Introduction</h2>
     <p class="bs">Have you ever thought that "Why  can the person finish homework faster than me?" or "Why do they learn something new faster than me? ," "What's the difference between me and them?" 
     </p><p class="bbs">I have thought like that for countless times sadly. As some of you know, there are several factors affecting learning ability, including environment, time, noise, and of course your personality. Most students have gone through trial and error to find out how do they get more engaged and efficiently when they work on their task. I am also the student who's been struggling to find out the best way to learn something new and get a good score on the exam. First time, I failed. Second time, I failed again. Third time, I realized that I should know about myself first. </p>
     
     <p class="bbs">Eventually, that experience became the catalyst for undertaking this project though, in this website, we'll break down the 16 types of learning styles and give pratical tips for how you cnalyze personality. This is not styles that you've always done, but an ideal style. it explores your character from 40 questions I made, so do not trust this test completely. It just suggests your personality, and best way to learn. This project is for myself and of course for everyone. I will hope you to find out your best way to make your life more fulfilling and enjoyable. Before learning about your unique learning style, here are some principles behind these learning styles.</p>
     
     <p class="bbs"></p>
     
     <h2 id="jump2">Chronotype</h2>
     <p class="bbs">Chronotype refers to your natural tendency to be more alert and active at certain times of the day. Some people are naturally more alert in the morning, what is called "Early Bird" while others are more alert in the evening, what is called "Night Owl." Understanding your chronotype can help you optimize your study schedule.</p>
     <p class="bbs">Morning activities are best suited for the early morning hours. After lunch, concentration temporarily drops and drowsiness is more likely to set in. Since work efficiency declines during this time, taking a nap of about 20 minutes allows you to tackle tasks efficiently afterward with a refreshed mind. In the morning, your brain is reset from sleep. This time of day carries less fatigue and stress from the previous day, making you ready to absorb new information. Additionally, recalling what you learned the day before from a fresh state can help solidify memories. Leverage the strengths of being a morning person! Wake up early to achieve your goals and significantly boost your productivity for the entire day.</p>
     <p class="bbs">On the other hand, night owls are more alert and productive in the evening. They may find it easier to focus and be creative during nighttime hours.  This suits people who don't perform well in the morning but feel their minds sharpen in the evening. Another appealing aspect is that late at night, there are fewer messages from friends or social media updates compared to daytime, reducing smartphone temptations. One piece of advice is to develop the habit of being able to switch back to mornings if needed. Nighttime makes it easier to extend study hours, and cutting back on sleep allows for longer study sessions. However, these risks disrupting your daily rhythm. If your habits make it difficult to wake up in the morning, it could lead to poor health and decreased performance. Furthermore, important exams and entrance tests are almost always held in the morning. Therefore, make sure you can switch to a morning routine when necessary. If you get used to your nighttime activities, you will not be able to display your ability because your brain will not be activated. For research purposes, scientists have developed several questionnaires that categorize subjects by morning type versus evening type tendencies.</p>
     
     <h2 id="jump3">With Friends?</h2>
     <p class="bbs">There are two types of people, those who learn better in a group and those who learn better alone. Let's call the first type "Social Learners" and the other type "Solitary Learners". Social learners are often extroverts. Some simply enjoy interacting with others, while others ruminate their own knowledge by teaching others. Studying alone or with friends—this is probably an eternal debate among students. Anyone who's tried group study has likely experienced this: you start studying because a friend invited you, but they keep asking questions, distracting you, or start talking about other things, making it impossible to focus. After all, your level of concentration changes depending on who you're with, and some people actually find it harder to focus when others are around. This ties into the discussion about environment later, but understanding your own personality is the most important thing. Those easily swayed by others will likely be distracted even when studying with someone. Conversely, self-assured individuals can focus on their tasks even if others around them are doing different things. Kind-hearted people who worry too much about others are overwhelmingly more efficient when alone. Definitely test which type you are.</p>
     
     <h2 id="jump4">Environment</h2>
     <p class="bbs">The environment greatly effects people. Japanese people often care about others deeply. Those who extend this concern to even the smallest details of daily life can wear themselves out mentally by constantly being around others. Such people need a safe, secure environment where they feel at ease. If your home is a safe environment, working there is most efficient. Finding a dedicated workspace with your own set spot can also boost productivity. Conversely, people who struggle to concentrate or discipline themselves in their own room need the feeling of being watched by others. Places like cafes or libraries suit them better. If you find yourself slacking off or constantly checking your phone when alone in your room, you need to take the plunge and step into a new environment.</p>
     
     <h2 id="jump5">Planner or Activist</h2>
     <p class="bbs">Some people prefer to plan their study sessions in advance, while others prefer to dive in and adapt as they go. The former are called "Planners" and the latter are "Activists". Planners tend to be more organized and methodical, while Activists are more spontaneous and flexible. Understanding your preference can help you choose the most effective study approach for your learning style. Perfectionists find meaning even in thoroughly completing every task they set for themselves. While maintaining that motivation is admirable, rigidly planning everything from the start can limit your actions. Those whose moods shift easily aren't suited to meticulously planning their studies. Set broad goals, but remember: the heart of studying is consistency. It's crucial to find ways to keep yourself in a good mood and enjoy learning, using whatever methods work for you.</p>
